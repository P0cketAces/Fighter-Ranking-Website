            <p>FighteRank, utilizes an algorithm to determine
            who the best UFC fighters in the world currently are. This is based on a
            recursive search that factors in all of the fighters who the given fighter has
            fought, and adds or subtracts a scoring value based on the win/loss ratios of those fighters.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Given: </strong>Fighter A has defeated Fighter B and Fighter C and lost to fighter D</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm: </strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. </strong>Check out the wins and losses of fighters B, C, and D</p>
            <p><strong>2. </strong>Come up with that fighter's specific win ratio</p>
            <p>(example) B has 4 wins 3 losses, his/her win ratio is 4/7</p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>Now put the information in this equation relative to fighter A:</p>
            <p>A = (((B's win ratio) + (C's win ratio)) - (1 - D's win ratio)) / (Total fights of A)</p>
            <p><strong>4. </strong>Normalize the values and map them from 0 to 100</p>
